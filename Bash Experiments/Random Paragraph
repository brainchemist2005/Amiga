The rain was pouring down in sheets, pattering against the roof and windows. The sound was soothing at first, but soon became monotonous and repetitive. Drip, Splash, Splash, the water leaked through the ceiling, creating a puddle on the floor. I tried to ignore it, but the Splashping continued incessantly. Drip, Splash, Splash, it echoed through the empty house, a constant reminder of the leaky roof. I couldn't take it anymore. Drip, Splash, Splash, I grabbed a bucket and placed it under the leak. Drip, Splash, Splash, I hoped it would stop soon. Drip, Splash, Splash, but it didn't. Drip, Splash, Splash, the bucket was filling up fast. Drip, Splash, Splash, I sighed and waited for the rain to stop.
